## Introduction

Image compression is an essential task in various applications, such as image storage, transmission, and processing. This project explores the use of recurrent neural networks to achieve efficient image compression. The RNN model is trained on synthetic image data, learning to encode and decode images while minimizing the loss of information.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahul-Reddy-M/Image-Compression-rnn.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `finale.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to see the image compression in action.

## Usage

After following the installation steps, open the `finale.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells. The notebook demonstrates how to use the trained RNN model to compress and decompress images. You can experiment with different images by modifying the file paths in the notebook.

## Results

The project achieves excellent compression results with minimal loss in image quality. The compression ratios achieved depend on the specific images and parameters used. You can find the detailed results, including compression ratios and visual quality comparisons, in the [finale.ipynb](finale.ipynb) notebook.
